# What is this?
This is the project I used to learn some of the basics of using behave in conjunction with selenium to automate testing a REST API

# Disclaimer
The API was not written by me, it was only used for the purpose of learning how to navigate the above mentioned tools. The files written by me are as follows

## Locators
This folder contains the code to call/identify specific pieces of the web pages whether by class name, ID or tag

## Page model 
Contains classes which make it easier to call for certain data from each of their associated web pages (found in template folder)

## Steps
Contains the code that actually causes the automated process to happen split by steps and the type of action being taken

## Webdrivers
contains the location of my local instance of the gecko(Firefox) driver. I initially used the webdrivermanager but kept it just in case.

and naturally the feature file in the acceptance folder was written by me.
